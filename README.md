## Prerequisites

Use a tested browser: Chrome or Safari.
Since the CSS was scanned by Autoprefixer, it should also work on other browsers.
When using Safari, select this from the menu:  Develop > Disable Local File Restrictions.
This needs to be set in order to maintain user data.
I have yet to find a way to enable local file usage in Javascript.

## Installation

Read the README.md file (this file).
Copy the index.html file and the css, img, and js directories to your system.

## Instructions

In your browser open the index.html file.

Start by entering a short name, i.e., what you want to be called by the game.  Enter it in the red text box and hit enter.  Use the same name (case sensitive) every time you want to play. Names must be 2-8 characters in length.

As soon as you hit the enter key the game timer starts.

Choose a card by clicking on it.  Try to match this card by clicking on a second card.  After 3.5 seconds both cards will automatically turn face down.  Then continue clicking pairs of cards until you've matched all pairs.

In order to speed things up, you need not wait for the 3.5 seconds to elapse - you can click on a third card.  When you do, the first two cards will turn face down and the third card will turn face up.  Then continue.
NOTE:  If you play too fast, you may get confused and think that the game has not turned cards over correctly!  Keep going.  You may have clicked when the timer expired.  If you double click the game will turn a card face up and back down.  This will merely increase the number of plays you use, so it's not wise to do it.

If at any time you want to start over, click the restart button.  If you do, you'll have to re-enter your name.  Nothing is saved.

When the you've completed a game, you'll have the options to cancel or restart (OK button).  Use restart when another person wants to play since it'll ask for his/her name.  Use cancel when you want to play again.  In this case, click on your game name and it'll reset with you playing another game.

The star ratings are:  30 plays or less - 3 stars, 38 or less - 2 stars, 48 or less - 1 star.
